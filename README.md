# Electronic Clam

**Agents must keep working — your Mac shouldn't cook trying.**
It detects *work*, not just a running process.

## Highlights

- **Lid-closed keep-awake.** One toggle stops your Mac from sleeping even with the lid shut — no terminal commands, no password per toggle.
- **Detects work, not processes.** Stays awake only while a coding agent is *actively producing output*; once the agent stops, your Mac can sleep again.
- **5 agents out of the box** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, Antigravity — plus any others you add yourself.
- **Safety guards that adapt.** Auto-sleeps when battery or temperature crosses a danger line.
- **Remote-activity aware.** Won't sleep while you're on it over SSH, screen sharing, or Tailscale — and keeps remote builds alive.
- **Never reads your conversations or code.** Agent detection only looks at transcript timestamps, never their contents.

## Features

The goal is to keep your agent working — **safely** — without interruption. Everything below serves that.

### Agent-aware keep-awake

![Agent-aware detection demo](docs/assets/eclam-demo-agents.gif)

The point is simple: let your agent keep working, uninterrupted.

So the toggle tracks whether the agent is *working right now*, not whether a process exists. While it works, the Mac stays awake; when it stops, the hold releases (**Strict** mode). A **Lax** mode that simply stays awake while the process is alive is also available.

**Detected by default (5):** Claude Code · Codex · Cursor · opencode · Antigravity.

**Opt-in via Customize (off by default):** Aider · Cline · Roo Code · OpenHands · Hermes · Openclaw.

Agents not listed here can be added too — give a glob pattern, or drop a single declaration file into `~/.config/eclam/traces.d/*.json`.

By default agents are detected by polling their session logs (~5 s, ~30 s while the screen is locked), so a just-started agent can take a few seconds to appear. Claude, Codex, and Hermes can be detected instantly by installing their (optional) hooks.

### Safety guards

![Safety guard demo](docs/assets/eclam-demo-safety.gif)

Running a heavy workload in clamshell mode inside a bag is a thermal risk. Electronic Clam watches temperature and battery, and lets the Mac sleep when things get risky:

- **Battery** — the threshold depends on your setup: 30% with the lid closed and no external display, 10% otherwise (adjustable). A weak or unstable AC connection counts as battery.
- **Thermal** — combines the macOS signal with a more sensitive internal one to react faster.
- **Max duration** — Desktop mode (AC + lid open + external display) skips the cap entirely.
- **Low Power Mode** — tightens both by one step (+10pp battery, one thermal notch).

With AC unplugged and the lid closed in a bag it judges more conservatively, then clears automatically once things are safe again. You can opt into a notification when it puts the Mac to sleep.

### Remote-activity awareness

![Remote awareness demo](docs/assets/eclam-demo-remote.gif)

Electronic Clam won't sleep while you're using the Mac remotely. It detects SSH, screen sharing, Tailscale, and known remote-control apps. The default is simple: stay awake as long as you're connected.

### Telegram notifications (off by default)

Connect your own Telegram bot and you'll get a ping when an agent stops or your Mac goes to sleep — with battery %, temperature, and host name attached.

### Other

- **CLI + named sessions** — drive it straight from the terminal (see [Usage](#usage)).
- **Optional agent hooks** — installing injects an activity-signal hook into Claude / Codex / Hermes configs; uninstalling restores them.
- **Guaranteed sleep restore on exit** — three layers: synchronous restore on quit, a SIGTERM handler, and a 20-second watchdog if the app crashes.
- **Clamshell VPN lock guard (opt-in).** With no external display on battery, closing the lid normally *locks* the screen — which drops a FortiClient SSL VPN (it needs a SAML re-login to reconnect). An invisible virtual display anchors the session so the screen doesn't lock and the tunnel survives. The **Blank screen** action also splits into **Dim** (dark but VPN-safe, default) vs **Sleep**, with an optional VPN-disconnect notification.
- **Resilient helper setup** — won't register the background helper from a quarantined download or a temporary (translocated) location, where macOS blocks it; it guides you to move the app to Applications instead. Settings → General flags duplicate copies and version mismatches, and `eclam repair` / **Reinstall Helper** recover a wedged registration.

## Install

```bash
brew install --cask jadhvank/tap/eclam
open /Applications/ElectronicClam.app
```

Turn on **Electronic Clam Helper** in **System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions**.

## Usage

**Left-click** the menu bar icon to toggle keep-awake. **Right-click** opens the full menu.

The icon is a clam shell with three states: an outline shell (asleep), a filled shell + bolt (you're holding it awake), and a filled shell + remote mark (an agent, remote session, or safety hold is keeping it awake automatically).

### Menu

| Item | Action |
|---|---|
| Status header | Current state at a glance (e.g., "Asleep when idle", "Awake — until I quit", "Awake — remote session") |
| **Keep Mac Awake** (⌘K) | Toggle keep-awake |
| **Watch Agents** ▸ | Enable/disable the agents to detect (shows " • active" when one is); **Customize…** at the bottom |
| **Blank screen — keep working** | Sleep the displays but keep the Mac and agents running |
| **Settings…** (⌘,) | Open settings |
| **Quit** (⌘Q) | Quit (restores sleep first) |

### CLI

The Homebrew cask creates a `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/eclam` symlink.

```
eclam on [--for <dur>] [--forever]   # keep awake; default 2h, then the helper auto-releases (no GUI needed, survives reboot)
eclam off
eclam status [--json]                 # also flags a quarantined/outside-Applications app, a failed helper, and duplicate copies
eclam repair                          # recover a wedged/unreachable helper (relaunches the app; guides you to sfltool resetbtm as a last resort)
eclam keep --while <pid>
eclam watch <agent> [--grace s] [--check-interval s] [--max min] [--json]
eclam session start <name> [--message <text>] / stop <name> / list [--json]
eclam debug [agents] [--json]
eclam help
```

**Exit codes:** `0` success · `1` bad arguments · `2` helper unreachable · `3` approval required · `4` user cancelled.

## Security & privacy

- Reads file clocks, not file contents.
- No telemetry, no tracking, no analytics.
- XPC caller verification is enforced.
- Developer ID signed + Apple notarized.
- Tokens stay local.
- Sleep is always restored on exit or crash.
- One permission path (`SMAppService`).

See [Security & privacy](docs/security.md) for details.

## Cautions / Known limitations

- **Detection can lag a few seconds without a hook.** Agents without an installed hook are detected by polling their session logs (~5 s, ~30 s while locked). Claude / Codex / Hermes are instant once you install their hooks.
- **No safety guards in CLI-only use.**
- **Run it from Applications.** Launched from Downloads or a still-quarantined copy, macOS won't let the background helper start — move Electronic Clam to your Applications folder and reopen it.
- **VS Code–embedded agents** (Cline / Roo Code) have no standalone process, so Lax-mode detection is limited.
- **Apple Silicon only**, macOS 13+ (Ventura).

## Tech stack

- **Language / UI:** Swift + AppKit (`NSStatusItem`, `LSUIElement` menu bar app — no Dock).
- **Power control:** IOKit SPI — `IOPMSetSystemPowerSetting("SleepDisabled")` via an `@_silgen_name` binding.
- **Privilege separation:** an `SMAppService` daemon talking to the app over `NSXPCConnection` (mach service).
- **Build:** direct `swiftc` (no SwiftPM), **no external dependencies**.
- **Targets:** arm64, macOS 13+ (Ventura).

## Build from source

```bash
./scripts/build.sh            # app + helper + hook binaries (Developer ID signed)
open build/ElectronicClam.app
```

- Direct `swiftc` invocation, `arm64-apple-macos13.0` target. Set `ECLAM_SIGN_ID=-` for fast ad-hoc local builds.
- Bundle layout: `Contents/MacOS/{ElectronicClam, ElectronicClamHelper, eclam-hook}` + `Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jadhvank.eclam.helper.plist`.
- Release builds are Developer ID–signed and notarized (stapled by `release.sh`).

## Release history

Recent releases — full history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md):

- **0.6.5** — Fix: with the clamshell lock guard enabled, connecting a TV via **screen mirroring** now works. Mirrored displays (a mirrored TV, AirPlay) were invisible to the guard — macOS drops a mirror-set member from the active display list and reports the whole mirror set as a single screen — so the invisible anchor kept re-mirroring and re-creating itself while macOS was negotiating the mirror session. Extended (side-by-side) displays were never affected. The guard also no longer creates its anchor while a mirror set is active, which used to leave an unreclaimable virtual display behind and disable the guard for the rest of the login session.
- **0.6.4** — Fixes for the clamshell VPN lock guard: the VPN-disconnect notification now actually fires (it was stopped by the very event it reports, and by App Nap), the invisible anchor is released when you quit the app, the virtual display is named clearly, and brightness is restored when you reopen the lid after **Dim**. Also: the menu-bar item no longer shows a dead-end "move to Applications" prompt when only a quarantine attribute is left, and the thermal cutoff default moved from `fair` to `serious` (the old default could end a keep-awake session within minutes).
- **0.6.3** — Fix: with the clamshell lock guard enabled, attaching a real external display no longer disturbs your saved built-in + external arrangement. The invisible anchor now steps aside immediately (no re-mirror) when a real display appears, letting macOS restore your saved layout; it returns automatically when the external is removed. Headless clamshell lock protection is unchanged.
- **0.6.2** — Clamshell VPN lock guard (opt-in): with no external display on battery, closing the lid no longer locks the screen, so a FortiClient SSL VPN survives instead of dropping — an invisible virtual display anchors the session. The "Blank screen" action now lets you choose **Dim** (VPN-safe, default) or **Sleep**, with an optional VPN-disconnect notification.
- **0.6.1** — Honest helper status: a dead-but-registered helper no longer shows a false "enabled". `eclam status` reports it as `unreachable` (exit 2), the app self-repairs on relaunch, a new `eclam repair` command and a menu-bar warning surface it, and `eclam status` now also reports the Open-at-Login state.
- **0.6.0** — Open at Login, in-app update notifications, awake history, internationalization (English · 한국어 · 中文 · 日本語 · Español), single-click toggle, menu-bar icon themes, remote idle policy, Telegram status notifications, Developer ID signing + notarization.

Earlier: agent-aware detection and the `watch` / `session` CLI (0.5.x), state-conditioned battery / thermal / timer safety guards (0.4.x), remote-activity awareness and the first CLI (0.3.x).
